= Tinker Maven Publish Plugin

This is a gradle plugin to publish the artifacts required by https://github.com/Tencent/tinker[Tencent Tinker].
It includes the android apk, mapping.txt and R.txt.
In next build, if you set the baseVersion, this plugin will download artifacts and set to Tinker.

== How to integrate

. Using the plugins DSL:
[source,gradle]
----
plugins {
  id "io.github.noproxy.tinker-maven-publish" version "0.0.1"
}
----

. Using legacy plugin application:
[source,gradle]
----
buildscript {
  repositories {
    maven {
      url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/"
    }
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath "io.github.noproxy:tinker-maven-publish:0.0.1"
  }
}

[source,groovy]

            name 'PrivateRepo'
        }

// all values in the extension have default value. You can simply leave out.
tinkerPublish {
    // default is the version name of your appliaction
    // this version is used to upload
    version = "1.1.0"

    // default "org.tinker.app"
    groupId = "org.tinker.app"

}

tinkerResolver {
    // version of the base apk, before Tinker build, we will download all files
    version = "1.0.1"
}

/*
    // If you want set local file as basement:
tinkerResolver {
    apk = 'local_file/1.0.1.apk'

== How to use

=== build and upload apk, mapping.txt and R.txt.

Run:
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew publishAppReleasePublicationToPrivateRepo
----
The `PrivateRepo` is the name of the maven repository you add in `publishing {}` block.

=== specific version to build tinker patch

You should set the baseVersion by 'tinkerResolver.version = 'xxx''.

[source,groovy]
----
tinkerResolver {
    version = "1.0.1"
}
----
[NOTE]
If you don't have any previous version, please set version to null. Because unresolved dependencies
will cause the build abort.

Then:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew tinkerPatchRelease
